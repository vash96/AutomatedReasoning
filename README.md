# AutomatedReasoning
Final project for Automated Reasoning course.

# Objective
Define and study the problem of the Minimal [Tree Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition) of a graph.

Define models to solve the problem in:
- [Answer Set Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) using [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) tool.
- [Constraint Logic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programming) using [Minizinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) modeling language.
